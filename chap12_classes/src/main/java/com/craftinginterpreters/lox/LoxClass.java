We needed to ensure that we understood the task each method we tested within the larger class, which may have taken some review of the algorithm itself before attempting to write the test. Keeping in mind the other developers on the team, we also separated our code into our own directory within the project in addition to our own branches to ensure we did not have any crossover. Beforehand when we did our refinement session, we decided that everyone would decide on their own tasks, but would verify what everyone else was working on before putting code down.
