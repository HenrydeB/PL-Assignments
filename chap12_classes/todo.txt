- figure out how to tell the difference between a class call and a static
  method
	- one way to do this is to check scoping => How does Lox handle class scoping?
	- we also need to look out for nested classes
	- an issue we will have is the main difference between class decl and
		static methods is the parenthesis for arguments for static methods
	- He explains we can use metaclasses, which is a class whose instances are
		also classes
	- I think we can use this for when we want to search for the method?
- need to add a new FunctionType
